# Tatar Tele Translit

The program is designed for transliteration in the Tatar language from Cyrillic to Latin and vice versa.

This is necessary for transliterating text, for example, when translating an application into Tatar (Latin or Cyrillic).

The application does not currently implement the conversion of the following letters:
- q [къ]
- ğ [гъ]
- w [ӱ]
These letters in the version with Cyrillic alphabet are not written explicitly, but are indicated only in transcription. However, in Latin they are written explicitly.
This remark is worth taking into account. Perhaps in the next version of the application, this problem will be fixed. You can also help with this issue if possible.
